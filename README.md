[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ant-fx/arnold-backtester/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=1CF7QD9N5O)](https://codecov.io/gh/ant-fx/arnold-backtester)

The ethos behind Arnold is to allow for advanced backtesting of stocks using
tick and bid/ask data and provide a different order types like:

- Market
- Limit
- Stoploss (Trailing + Fixed)
- Bracket

It will also let you load other symbol data at the same time, for example you
could check the `SPY` while trading `MSFT`.

It should let you graphically analyse each trade in context to better help
understand the strategy.
